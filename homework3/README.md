This application is designed to generate a password for a user based on individualized responses to the preliminary question prompts. Once a unique password is generated, the application permits the user to copy the password to the clipboard for easy subsequent pasting. 

The minimal aesthethic design is enabled through bootstrap, and javascript enables the functionality of the automated password generation. 

The password generator can be found online here:
