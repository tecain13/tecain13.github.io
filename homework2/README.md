### Homework #2

* By leveraging bootstrap, I was able to employ some out-of-the-box
* elements as opposed to hard-coding aesthetic features in a 
* separate CSS file. Although I did still customize the look and

* bootstrap's grid feature expediting the placement of elements on
* the screen and permitted optimization for mobile devices with
* smaller viewports.
