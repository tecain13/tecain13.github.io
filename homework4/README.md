### Problem
​
As a fullstack student, someone may like to test their general knowledge of the field in the form of a quiz. 
​
### Solution
​
This quiz provides an opportunity to answer general questions related to coding and coding history while tracking the accuracy of the answers as they proceed through the series of questions

## Tech and Features Used
​
* Bootstrap
* Javascript
* This Code Explained Youtube tutorial proved especially helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49pYIMygIcU, and served as the foundational basis for my code, which I later ended up heavily modifying by: adding a global timer, a high score button intended to capture historic high scores via local storage, the submission of a user's initials, a different approach/method for evaluating a user's score (with time remaining playing a major factor in final score tabulation), and aesthetic/CSS edits. 
* This series of tutorials from James Q Quick
also supplemented my learning: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFWbAj40JrQ&list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx&index=2

* Additionally, my tutor Simon Rennocks saved my life on this one. Many thanks.

## How to use
​
A user will be introduced with a page asking them to begin/initialize the quiz, at which point they will be presented with individual questions prior to receiving a final score.

## Note to TA's
Riley and Isaac: I seriously struggled with the local storage concept and the implementation of a time penalty. And, naturally, my code is incomplete and inefficient. Any guidance you could provide on those aspects would be greatly appreciated.
