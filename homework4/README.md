This homework assignment is designed to integrate a series of functions in the form of a quiz.  The user has the ability to initialize the quiz with a start screen, and upon entering the quiz a timer starts permitting a total time of 75 seconds. A time penalty is introduced for each question answered incorrectly, and a final score is calculated and saved. 

This Code Explained Youtube tutorial proved especially helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49pYIMygIcU, and served as the foundational basis for my code, which I later ended up heavily modifying by: adding a global timer, a high score button intended to capture historic high scores via local storage, the submission of a user's initials, a different approach/method for evaluating a user's score (with time remaining playing a major factor in final score tabulation), and aesthetic/CSS edits. This series of tutorials from James Q Quick
also supplemented my learning: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFWbAj40JrQ&list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx&index=2

Additionally, my tutor Simon Rennocks saved my life on this one. Many thanks.

Riley and Isaac: I seriously struggled with the local storage concept and the implementation of a time penalty. And, naturally, my code is incomplete and inefficient. Any guidance you could provide on that would be greatly appreciated.
